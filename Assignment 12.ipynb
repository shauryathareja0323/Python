    "# Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "# A2. Advantages:\n",
    "#     1. Interoperability: APIs enable different software systems and platforms to communicate and work together. \n",
    "#        This promotes interoperability, allowing developers to leverage existing services and data in their\n",
    "#        applications.\n",
    "#     2. Reuse of Code and Resources: APIs promote code reuse. Developers can use existing APIs to access \n",
    "#        functionality, data, or services, saving time and effort in coding everything from scratch.\n",
    "#     3. Security: APIs can enhance security by providing controlled access to data and functionality. Access can\n",
    "#        be restricted, monitored, and authenticated to protect sensitive information.\n",
    "#     4. Cross-Platform Compatibility: APIs enable cross-platform compatibility. Applications can be developed \n",
    "#        for various operating systems and devices, ensuring broader reach.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Disadavantages:\n",
    "#     1. Complexity: APIs can introduce complexity, especially in systems with numerous interdependencies.\n",
    "#        Managing multiple APIs and their updates can be challenging.\n",
    "#     2. Dependency on Third Parties: When using external APIs, you rely on the availability and reliability of \n",
    "#        the third-party service. If that service goes down or changes its API, it can impact your application.\n",
    "#     3. Security Risks: Poorly designed or insecure APIs can expose vulnerabilities in your application. \n",
    "#        Unauthorized access, data leaks, and other security risks can occur if APIs are not properly secured."
