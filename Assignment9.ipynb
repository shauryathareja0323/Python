    "#  1. Improved performance: Multithreading can help increase the overall performance of an application, \n",
    "#     especially on systems with multiple processors or cores. It allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, \n",
    "#     utilizing the available CPU resources more efficiently.\n",
    "#  2. Responsiveness: In a single-threaded environment, if a long-running task blocks the main thread, the entire\n",
    "#     application becomes unresponsive. Multithreading can prevent this issue by running such tasks in separate \n",
    "#     threads, ensuring the application remains responsive.\n",
    "#  3. Better resource utilization: Multithreading allows better utilization of system resources by keeping the CPU\n",
    "#     busy while waiting for I/O operations or other tasks to complete.\n",
    "#  4. Simplified modeling: Some problems can be more naturally modeled using multiple threads. This makes the \n",
    "#     program easier to design, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "#  5. Parallelism: Multithreading enables parallelism, which can lead to significant performance improvements in\n",
    "#     applications that can be divided into smaller, independent tasks.\n",
    "#     Some of the disadvantages are:\n",
    "#  1.Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to the program, making it more difficult to design, implement, and\n",
    "#    debug. Developers need to be aware of synchronization, deadlocks, race conditions, and other \n",
    "#    concurrency-related issues.\n",
    "#  2.Synchronization overhead: To avoid data corruption and maintain consistency, developers must synchronize\n",
    "#    access to shared resources, which can result in additional overhead and reduced performance.\n",
    "#  3.Context switching: Context switching between threads consumes CPU time and resources, which can lead to\n",
    "#    performance degradation if not managed efficiently.\n",
    "#  4.Hard to predict behavior: Due to the concurrent nature of multithreading, the behavior of the program can \n",
    "#    be hard to predict and reproduce, especially when it comes to debugging.\n",
    "#  5.Limited by hardware: The performance benefits of multithreading are limited by the number of available cores\n",
